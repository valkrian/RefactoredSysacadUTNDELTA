# ADR 0003: Frontend stack - Angular and Bootstrap

Status: Accepted
Date: 2025-12-21

## Context
We need a modern admin-style UI that can be delivered quickly.

## Decision
Use Angular (standalone) for the SPA and Bootstrap for UI styling.

## Consequences
- Fast layout development and consistent components.
- Adds a Node toolchain and Bootstrap dependency.
- UI aligns with a classic admin system look.
